# DaedalusX64
 
DaedalusX64 is a Nintendo 64 emulator for Linux and PSP, with plans to port to Windows, Mac and PS Vita among other platforms. The PSP port is noteworthy for being the fastest N64 emulator ever on the platform, achieving close to or even full speed in many titles.

## Features:
 
- Fast emulation
- High compatibility
- Support for PSP TV Mode with 240p and 480p output!
- Active support and updates
 
And more!
 
## Usage
 
To install Daedalus to your PSP, download the latest release from the Releases page: https://github.com/DaedalusX64/daedalus/releases
 
Next, plug your PSP into your computer and navigate to /PSP/GAME/. Create a folder called "daedalus" there, and place the EBOOT.PBP file inside. Place your ROM files in daedalus/Roms/ and they will automatically appear in Daedalus.
 
Note: If the release is a ZIP file with a folder containing an EBOOT.PBP file when extracted, simply drag and drop the extracted folder into /PSP/GAME/.
